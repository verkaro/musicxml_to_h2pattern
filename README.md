# musicxml_to_h2pattern

This is my attempt to make a musicxml to hydrogen pattern converter.

I feel that most of the initial work is done (thanks chat.gpt) but
we've come to a standstill on proper note distribution in the rendered file.
They pile up on the 1st beat of the pattern like spaghetti on a wall, or
something.

I am open to clues. This is my 1st bit of shared code, the whole experience
is new. FYI the wiki is open for casual communication over this code. Which I
believe has some promise.
